# Grand Canyon University
# CST135 - Java II
# CookieJar

Every time I teach the Java II class at Grand Canyon University, I have the students select the topic for the program we are going to build in the class. For this iteration, the students selected a parent class of Dessert and children classes of Cookie and Cake. To keep the lessons manageable, we limit the attributes and the methods to just a handful.
In the code, you will see how the project grows with each class and how we continual advance the knowledge and the complexity. We start off with the hierachy and grow into static methods for display.  The last part is our persistance layer using file I/O as the students have not learned SQL or JDBC interaction as this point, they learn those pieces in the next Java class.
For this project here is a list of concepts covered:
## OOP - Encapsulation
## OOP - Polymorphism
## OOP - Inheritance
## OOP - Abstration
## Collection - List/ArrayList
## CRUD (Create/ Read/ Update / Delete)
## Static methods
## Overloading
## Overriding
## Constructors
